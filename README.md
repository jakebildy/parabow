Parabow uses a voice recognition release system to allow paraplegic athletes to compete in para-archery without having to use their mouth/neck as release mechanism.

Code comprises three sections - 

1. The companion app to allow the bow to connect to WiFi
2. The source code for the actual release mechanism
3. The server-side python code to actually analyze the audio
